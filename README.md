Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  -Software engineering is using well known engineering principles,methods and tools for meintaining and developing high-quality systems
  - software engineering is importantsince;
      *Helps in developing of systems and applications that plays a crusial role in life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   1.Development of a programing languages
   2)Establishing a software engineering as a discipline
   3)Rise of agile methodology


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1)Requirements Gathering:
  -This is simmply collecting/gathering of the user and system requirements in enebling the functionality of the system
2)System Designing:
  -This is simply coming up with a high-level system desighn that touches on the system archtecture and user interface
3)System Development/implimentation:
  -This is simply coding the actual designed system as per the system design specification
4) Testing:
  -This simply trying out a system if it meets the inteted functionality or it can serve the purpose as required(quality standards and functional requirements)
5)Deploying:
  -This is simply releasing the software to users or customers
6)Maintainance:
  -This the ongoing monitoring ,updation,and ensuriing that the software continues giving a service as intended


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -Waterfall methodolog mainly focuses on the  sequencial approach with distict  phases  well it is simply applicable in large sequncial systems with clear approaches while Agile methodology focuses on iterative and incrimental approache which mainly takes key intrest on, flexibility,system-change and collaborative systems

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    -Software Developer takes a role in writing codes/simply developing a software as per the specified design.
    -Quality Assurance Engineer palys a role in ensuring that  the system is of high quality and follows meets quality requirement policy and as the functionality is met
    -Project Manager acts as the overseer of the whole project and acts as the point of communication between the client and the developer simply the oversees the planning , Execution and the presentetion of the project
    -Software Engineering team- This a group of members that takes part in ensuring the development of the system meets the software  engineering principles,methods and tools.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  -Integrated Development Environent helps in providing an environment of writing,Executing ,debugging and Testing codes in a specified language e.g vsCode
  -The Version controling system(Vcs) Plays role in detectiing/tracking change in the source code simply in the version control and helps in coordinating work between team members


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   1)Change requirements
   2)Tight deadlines 
   strategies:
   !)Frequent communication
   2)Using Agile design methodology 
   3)Prioritization of tasks
   4)Regular reassesing of project goals as well as Timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing -This is simply tesing a component of the system/software or module
-Intergration testing this is simply testing the interaction  between components of the software or subsystems
-System testing this is the type of testing that is done all through the system
-Acceptance testing this is doen mainly to test wether the systems meets he user needs'requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is simply crafting instractions in a way that enables the AI model to give a clear responce


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
*Provide the Whole history of creation
-"Briefly describe creation"
-It's clear ,concise and specific
